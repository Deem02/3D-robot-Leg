## Introduction

The robot leg design is intended for robotics enthusiasts and hobbyists who wish to explore the mechanics of robotic movement. Each leg uses three servo motors to allow for complex movement patterns and greater flexibility.

## Features

- **3D Designed**: Created using Tinkercad, an easy-to-use 3D design and modeling tool.
- **Servo Motor Integration**: Each leg has three servo motors to control the hip, knee, and ankle joints.
- **Educational Purpose**: Ideal for learning about robotic movement and mechanics.

## Requirements

### Hardware

- 3D Printer
- 3 Servo Motors per leg
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
- Power Supply for Servo Motors
- Connecting Wires and Hardware for Assembly

### Software

- Tinkercad (for design modifications)
- Arduino IDE (for programming the microcontroller)

## Installation

1. **Print the 3D Model**: Use a 3D printer to print the components of the robot leg from the Tinkercad design files.
2. **Attach Servo Motors**: Securely attach the servo motors to the designated joint positions on the 3D printed parts.
3. **Connect Joints**: Assemble the upper leg, lower leg, and foot by connecting them through the servo motors.
4. **Wiring and Electronics**: Connect the servo motors to a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) and ensure proper wiring for power and control signals.
5. **Programming**: Upload the control program to the microcontroller to enable movement.

## Usage

This robot leg model can be used for various educational and experimental purposes, including:

- Understanding the mechanics of robotic joints and movements.
- Learning about 3D design and printing techniques.
- Developing control algorithms for robotic limbs.
